One of the biggest problems are that Raspberry Pi do not show the schematics of the wireless. 
See this example: https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rpizero/raspberry-pi-zero-w-reduced-schematics.pdf

Thanks that we got access to a X-ray picture of the wireless chip, I tried to figure out some of the circuits. Not easy because that PCB is multilayer. So I just figured out some of them.

The best news are that RPi Zero w and RPi Zero 2 W wireless chip still in the same position, is not rotated and in both boards we should remove exactly the same SMD component. Cool!, isn't it? :)

### If you got the case that you would like just to remove the WiFi, just remove this component:
